# 1. Project Requirements:
1. Project Format The objective of the project is to use the main skills taught in this class to solve a real text mining problem. Students should work individually or form a group of up to three students to finish the project. 
 
 2. Choose text mining problem and data set For this project, you must choose your own dataset.  It can be one that you created yourself or found from other resources. Some rules/tips about choosing data sets:    
 	a. Do not choose the data sets that we have analyzed in class, such as the Kaggle Sentiment data, movie review data, etc.   
 	b. The data set should contain at least 100 examples.  
 	c. Choose a data set that does not require excessive preprocessing.
