While they still retain possibly the best quarterback ever in Tom Brady and made a flurry of moves, this year’s team won’t be the same. Among notable players, they lost Dwayne Allen, Trent Brown, Trey Flowers, Malcolm Brown, and Rob Gronkowski, but gained Michael Bennett, Terrence Brooks, Demaryius Thomas, and Ben Watson., Fresh off another Super Bowl victory, the New England Patriots are primed for another deep run at the playoffs and are atop the leaderboards in bets to repeat as champs. While they still retain possibly the best quarterback ever in Tom Brady and made a flurry of moves, this year’s team won’t be the same. Among notable players, they lost Dwayne Allen, Trent Brown, Trey Flowers, Malcolm Brown, and Rob Gronkowski, but gained Michael Bennett, Terrence Brooks, Demaryius Thomas, and Ben Watson., \nWhat does Tom Brady have left in the tank?\nAt this point in his career, Tom Brady has nothing left to prove. The Hall of Fame bound QB enters his 20th season as he looks to win yet another Super Bowl ring. However, he skillset remains elite and that trend is likely to continue moving forward. His passing numbers have actually been better in recent years, possibly indicating that age is just a number for him. The 65.8% completion rate last year beat his career average of 64% and the 4,355 passing yards was right in line for what he’s been averaging the past couple of years.\xa0\nThis year, expect more of the same from Brady though he might have to work tougher to get the same results. With Rob Gronkowski gone, his receivers will be covered more tightly and Brady will have to have greater precision on his throws. While this might result in more interceptions, I’ve learned you can never doubt Brady or any player of his caliber. I’ll project a 4,250 passing yards season with a 27/10 TD/INT ratio. While that’s not great, it’ll certainly get the job done and get the Patriots into the playoffs once again.\xa0\nWhat does New England plan to do with some many running backs\nRookie Sony Michel started in 8 games last season as was among the Patriots’ best skills position players. He produced 931 rushing yards and 6 TDs in an overall, very well balanced offense. This season, New England will expect similar numbers from their second year back but he’ll be receiving a bit more help this time around. James White and Rex Burkhead will continue to be around and help out in both the passing and running game though neither are great offensive weapons. Burkhead hasn’t been more than a third RB on the depth chart and White’s best moment is still his role in the infamous Super Bowl against the Falcons.\xa0\xa0\nJoining the crew this year will be Damien Harris who’s coming out of Alabama to New England via the 24th pick in the 3rd round. The #1 recruit out of high school, Harris was a consistent player throughout his collegiate career and has great potential in the league. However, with a crowded backfield and likely limited carries, it remains to see how the Patriots will utilize him. Harris brings a big, physical back that can run through the trenches and help secure yardage in short down situations.\xa0\nReplacing Rob Gronkowski\nAfter a great career, Rob Gronkowski finally decided to call it quits after last season. The move forced the Patriots to find a replacement for a role that very few in the game can provide and they did a solid job in filling that void. Both Ben Watson and Matt LaCosse were brought in as his replacement, though the latter will get first crack at the starting gig. With Watson serving a suspension for the first four games, LaCosse will have the opportunity to replicate his 2018 production though on a starter level. In 15 games including 5 starts, he collected 250 yards and 1 TD. While those stats don’t jump out, he’s the clear favorite to start at tight end for at least the first four games.\nIf LaCosse manages to produce and play well, Watson could very well see himself as the backup moving forward. On the contrary, he could see himself in game action by Week 5 and possibly the starter for the rest of the season should LaCosse struggle early on. In 16 games including 4 starts, he caught for 400 yards and 2 TDs. While those numbers are equally unimpressive, Watson does have extensive starting experience and the pleasure of playing under Tom Brady and Drew Brees earlier on in his career., At this point in his career, Tom Brady has nothing left to prove.

A busy offseason has left Oakland with a new outlook going into the 2019/20 campaign, and starts to shed some light onto the confusion surrounding some deals in the past -- mainly the unloading of star pass-rusher Khalil Mack. While I don't necessarily have the Raiders as likely Super Bowl contenders or even making it deep into the playoffs, I still think the year will leave the team and fans alike optimistic., In the midst of a lot of hype surrounding the Raiders' appearance on HBO's 'Hark Knocks' this year, they are also gearing up for what will likely be one of their more interesting seasons in the past decade. A busy offseason has left Oakland with a new outlook going into the 2019/20 campaign, and starts to shed some light onto the confusion surrounding some deals in the past -- mainly the unloading of star pass-rusher Khalil Mack. While I don't necessarily have the Raiders as likely Super Bowl contenders or even making it deep into the playoffs, I still think the year will leave the team and fans alike optimistic., \nWhat does Antonio Brown bring to this Raiders team?\nAfter a big dramatic exit with the Steelers this offseason, Antonio Brown will finally be suiting up in a new uniform come September. It seems like it's a good step for both Brown and the Steelers, as their time together was certainly coming to an end. What Brown brings to this Oakland offense is an incredibly solid WR1 who is going to propel their offense way past where it's been in years past. The Carr/Brown duo is going to be one to look out for this year, and I'm not quite sure the league will know exactly what to expect out of Brown on a new team. In my opinion, Brown pays off in dividends on the field for all the off-the-field chaos he's known to cause. The Raiders will be better off with Brown in black and gray.\nWhat happened with CB Nevin Lawson?\nOn August 6th, Nevin Lawson announced via Twitter that he would be suspended without pay for the first four games of the Raiders season. The reason? Testing positive for the NFL banned substance Ostarine. Lawson claims to have not taken the substance knowingly, but that doesn't really matter as the NFL puts it on the players to be aware of what they are ingesting at all times. Lawson will still be allowed to participate in all Raiders pre-season activities, so when the time comes for him to return to the field he will be ready to do so. Lawson isn't the first player to have been dished a suspension over banned substances this offseason and he likely won't be the last. Suspensions and injuries are usually reported around this time every year, and it's something you hate to see effect your team.\nIs this a make or break year for Carr?\nThe 28-year-old quarterback has had a couple of good seasons with the Raiders, but the last two have been incredibly subpar. His $125 million contract which, when it was inked, made Carr the highest paid player in the NFL, is coming to an end after next season. But I think all eyes will be on Carr as he finally has an elite target in Antonio Brown.  The last two seasons where the Raiders finished 6-10 and 4-12, respectively, make a bad argument for Carr being worth all that money. But as the Raiders continue to improve around him, I feel he has a chance to start proving the Raiders didn't make a mistake in inking that huge deal with him. , After a big dramatic exit with the Steelers this offseason, Antonio Brown will finally be suiting up in a new uniform come September.

They added C.J. Mosely in the offseason who will hopefully provide some stability at the LB position for Washington. Adding Landon Collins at safety was another great move, as a big playmaker like him will add a whole new dimension to their defense. Josh Norman and Fabian Moreau will be the CB duo, who both had solid years last year. The defense currently looks good, but not great. Unfortunately, that's the overall theme for the reference. Good, but not great. I don't see this current Redskins defense giving the team an edge to makeup for their weak offense.\nWhat will the Redskins offense look like this season?\nWith Alex Smith counted out for returning, it’s hard to know exactly what the quarterback position will look like for the Redskins this season. That being said, as of now it looks like Colt McCoy will line up as a starter to begin the season backed up by Case Keenum. Adrian Peterson, Chris Thompson, Derrius Guice, and Samaje Perine make up the backfield, giving the Redskins depth and the ability to run many different plays on the ground. Peterson was 8th in the NFL in rushing last year with 1,042 yards. Josh Doctson, Paul Richardson, and Trey Quinn make the starting WR line, while Jordan Reed will lineup at the TE spot. Reed had 2 TDs and 558 yards in 13 games played last year. Much like the defense, the offense has some good pieces but will by no means be elite.\nWhere do the Redskins' 2019 draft picks fit into the roster in 2019?\nFor starters, the most talked about Redskins' draft pick is QB Dwayne Haskins who they selected 15th overall out of Ohio State. While he could potentially be a franchise quarterback somewhere down the line, he's currently in the midst of a quarterback battle that seems like it'll be an ongoing thing all season. It seems that Colt McCoy holds the lead ahead of both Haskins and Case Keenum, but again, that's subject to change. Montez Sweat was the Redskins other first round draft pick taken at 26th overall. He's currently slotted at starting ROLB. In the third round, Washington added depth with Terry McLaurin, a WR out of Ohio State (who is undoubtedly familiar with Haskins). Washington got to see firsthand how detrimental not having substantial depth was last year in the face of injuries, so they went out and added some names that make the overall depth chart much stronger., Jonathan Allen and Da’Ron Payne were very solid at the defensive tackle position last year, but the Redskins’ weak linebacker corps was their Achilles heel.

They led the league in offense while their defense ranked 24th out of the NFL’s 32 teams.

Meanwhile, look for another great year from their many offensive weapons and a defense that will hopefully rank within the top half of the league.\xa0, \nWhat does bringing in Tyrann Mathieu do for the team?\nThe Chiefs defense wasn’t very good last year and one of their first moves in the offseason was to address just that. Tyrann Mathieu was brought in on a 3 year, $42 million deal that will help shore up the safety spot. However, he can do more than just that after spending the 2018 shuffling around the entire defense for Houston. He’s so versatile over the field and can offer Kansas City many different looks depending on what scheme they decide to play.\nMathieu also brings a veteran presence to the team and should be a defensive anchor for the next few years to come. He’ll certainly help turn around a unit that ranked in the bottom half of the league and look to be a constant starter for the Chiefs. While he might not be especially skilled a tone particular position, Mathieu offers all around skills and can essentially fill in whenever and wherever needed.\nWill the Jaguars defense continue to be one of the best?\nLast year, no Chiefs rookies did much and they definitely looked to change that with the 2019 draft class. Without a first round pick, they had to wait until pick #56 to draft Mecole Hardman who is likely going to be used all around the field and on special teams. The rookie wide receiver will likely see action behind Tyreek Hill. Next up is Juan Thornhill, the 63rd overall pick. The defensive back from Virginia will look to slot next to Mathieu in the secondary and play a big role in reshaping the Kansas City defense.\xa0\n\nKhalen Saunders will join the defensive line that’s already littered with a few other players. He’ll get a good shot at the starting job and should be able to put together a fairly solid rookie season if given that opportunity. However, Thronhill is likely the best bet to be productive in year 1 as he’s the only rookie guaranteed a starting job. With such a talented offense, Hardman might be pushed to the second unit and Saunders might be benched in favor of veteran run stoppers.\xa0\nIs Mahomes really this good?\nAfter playing just one game in 2017 serving as Alex Smith’s backup, the Chiefs finally gave Mahomes the starting gig in 2018 and he made the most of it. He compiled 5,097 passing yards and 50 TDs that led to his MVP award. He was absolutely brilliant in every game as he completed 66% of his passes and had a league leading QBR of 82. In addition to being a great passer as highlighted by some amazing on the run throws, Mahomes was a great dual threat QB. He rushed for 272 yards and 2 TDs on the year.\xa0\nWhether or not Mahomes can repeat that production is entirely up in the air. On one side, he’s young enough to continue developing and has the chance to continue exposing defenses in his second year as a starter.

On the flip side, defenses may have figured out all the tricks and will begin running different defenses to counter Mahomes. Whatever the case may be, the future looks bright for the MVP as he enters 2019 as one of the highest rated players in the league.]'}}

Their pass rush was alright, but other than that their defense was incredibly poor.

Bruce Arians is the new head coach, so hopefully he will bring tidings of joy for the Buccaneers., \nAre we looking at an improved defense this year for the Bucs?\n\nIn short, yes. The Bucs took Devin White, a LB from LSU with the fifth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. He'll immediately be slotted into a starting spot, and will be expected to to be a huge contributor on defense. They nabbed Sean Bunting, A CB out of Central Michigan in the second round who will be competing for a starting spot. If nothing else, adding more competition to the secondary will only work in the Bucs' favor. A team that has a strong pass-rush could certainly benefit from having some guys in the backfield able to make plays on balls they force to be thrown. CB Jamal Dean was added in the third round of this past draft, who only adds more competition for a starting spot.\n\nWhat can we expect from QB Jameis Winston this season?\n\nDoes anyone ever really know what to expect from Jameis Winston? Jameis is in the peculiar position of being a quarterback drafted first overall playing in the 5th and final year of his rookie deal not knowing what the future holds for him. He simply hasn't shown enough production for the Bucs to go all in on him yet. If he's ever going to, this is going to be the year. With a bright new head coach in Bruce Arians who has a history of turning QBs around, Winston will be out of excuses if he doesn't produce this year. With that looming in the back of his head, I predict that Winston has his strongest season yet. The stakes are high, yes, but for whatever reason, I trust that Winston will perform and get himself a nice extension.\n\nWhat should we expect form TE O.J. Howard this season?\n\nO.J. Howard has been talked about ever since he showcased his talents in the 2015 National Championship game where he put up 208 yard and two touchdowns against Clemson. Only since being drafted by the Bucs in 2017, he's missed 8 games. When he's on the field, there aren't many complaints. It's just a matter of making sure the young TE does stay on the field. That being said, even if he does stay healthy, there's a good chance he isn't used as as much of a weapon as he has been in the past two seasons. Newly acquired head coach Bruce Arians has a track record of not implementing TEs heavily into his offense and instead focusing mainly on WRs. He hasn't had a TE quite like Howard before, though, so we'll have to wait and see how Howard fits into Arians' offense this season.]""}}"

As mentioned before, this isn\'t the year things completely start unraveling, but Ingram having been with New Orleans for the past 8 years and then not resigning this year certainly feels like the start of something new happening. With the loss of Ingram, up-and-coming running back Alvin Kamara will be getting a lot more carries. So much so that he who was a top fantasy running back last year could be even more-so one this season. While any offense with Drew Brees at the helm is going to rely heavily on throwing the ball, there\'s still plenty of room for a strong run-game to take shape. Newly acquired Latavius Murray will also be getting some looks this season, despite having kind of an off season with the Vikings last year. \nHow much longer will Drew Brees be a part of this iconic Saints team?\nI\'ve already mentioned the Payton/Brees era of the Saints a few times. In my head, when I think of the Saints, those are the two faces that immediately pop into my head. Brees is currently 40 and will be 41 come January. The fact that his play hasn\'t seemed to drop off at all over the last few years is remarkable in and of itself. 2019 marks the year of the ""veteran"" quarterback with Tom Brady having just turned 42. Brees and Brady are in similar positions right now, in that neither of them have mentioned any plans of retirement and it\'s sort of on a ""we\'ll see when we get there"" basis. As of now, I\'d urge you to just enjoy the ride and take in all of the greatness Brees has to offer while he\'s still around.\nWhat does Teddy Bridgewater resigning with the Saints mean?\nAs of now, it seems to mean exactly what it appears. The Saints enjoyed having an experienced backup behind Brees who could come in at a moment\'s notice if Brees were to fall prey to injury. I\'m no doctor, but I believe that as someone gets older they become more prone to injury. Having Bridgewater there means that if Brees, God forbid, were to get injured, the Saints could still have a very good chance at maintaining a successful season. On top of this, Bridgewater seems to be who New Orleans is grooming to take Brees\' spot when the fateful day of his retirement comes.

Things look a little bit different for the Eagles in terms of a roster this year, mainly in Nick Foles no longer being a part of the team. Carson fell prey to injury again last year, leaving the remainder of the season in Nick Foles' hands. With Foles on the Jaguars now, there is no longer that strong safety net of a backup QB behind Wentz, who has shown himself to be quite injury prone in his first three seasons in the NFL., The Eagles were able to make it back to the playoffs last year but eventually fell short to the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Divisional Round.

With Foles on the Jaguars now, there is no longer that strong safety net of a backup QB behind Wentz, who has shown himself to be quite injury prone in his first three seasons in the NFL., \nWhat does not having Foles on the roster mean for the Eagles?\nWell, quite literally, it means that the QB backing Wentz is now Nate Sudfeld who's in his third season with the Eagles. Behind him is Clayton Thorson who the Eagles drafted in the 5th round of the NFL Draft this year out of Northwestern. The main difference, however, comes in the form of an overall feeling. If Wentz goes down due to an injury again this year, there simply is no more Nick Foles magic to come in behind him and hold things down. It's not necessarily a hot take to say that Foles is a stronger backup than Sudfeld. Foles is a starting-caliber QB who the Eagles managed to keep for years before he finally got his chance to live out that potential for the Jaguars this year. \nWhat can we expect from the Eagles defense this season?\nLast year, the Eagles defense ranked 15th in DVOA in the NFL. I'm of the belief that they'll rank much higher this year, as they already had one of the strongest defensive lines in the NFL last year and went out and added some more talent to beef it up. Malik Jackson and Vinny Curry make nice additions to that line that was already comprised of strong players in Fletcher Cox, Brandon Graham, and Derek Barnett. As of now, the linebacker position isn't something the Eagles are strong in, but their secondary seems to at least make up for some of that. If they're going to make a bid for a top defense in the league, it's going to be on the heels of their defensive line, though. There's just no way around that, as it is obviously the strongest part of this defense.\nIs this roster good enough to make another deep playoff run?\nIn short, yes. The Eagles have just as strong as a roster as most other playoff contenders. The difference? Well, they don't have nearly as difficult a schedule as other NFC contenders have slated for the year. Playing the Redskins and Giants twice should prove to be an easy four wins for the Birds. Meanwhile, the Bears, Saints, and Rams are all going to have to play their divisional opponents twice who are also looking at making Super Bowl runs, like the Packers, Falcons, Vikings, and Seahawks.

Elliott has been one of the most productive players in the league since his rookie year and appears to want to get paid ASAP. Elliott is certainly deserving of a big contract, but if he truly is asking for a record deal that surpasses Todd Gurley’s, the Cowboys may be right not to give him that much. For one, Todd Gurley’s deal looks like a mistake in retrospect, with his potentially arthritic knees putting a damper on things. Secondly, Elliott has had some off the field issues, the most notable of which got him a six game suspension that killed the Cowboys chances of making the playoffs in 2017. The Cowboys appear to be stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. Elliott is undoubtedly incredibly valuable to the team and not someone they can afford to let go, but overpaying him is a big risk, considering how many other mouths they need to feed. \nIs Dak Prescott Really Getting a 30 Million Deal?\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, Elliott isn’t the only one looking to secure the bag. The team’s franchise quarterback is asking for a deal that exceeds 30 million annually, a deal that would make him the highest paid quarterback in the league. While Dak is certainly an above average quarterback and is arguably the only player on the team who’s more deserving of an extension than Zeke, he isn’t the best of the best. When stacked up against the other 30 million-dollar quarterbacks in the league, he doesn’t seem to fare that well. Dak is solid but hasn’t shown the ability to uplift a team the way Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, or even Carson Wentz have. In a vacuum, Dak isn’t worth the money he’s requesting, but the Cowboys may have no choice in the end. While this deal would certainly be an overpay, the Cowboys don’t really have any options to replace Dak, and when it comes to overpaying Dak or losing him, they’d probably decide to overpay him first. \nWhich Player will the Cowboys Decide to Let Go?\nWhile Dak and Zeke are currently getting the most attention, the Cowboys have a host of other key players that are in line for contract extensions soon. While there have been issues with Elliott and Dak, their resigning does feel more like a matter of when not if. The same can’t be said about the other players on the Cowboys. Off the top of the list, three key players that are up for contract extensions this year are wide receiver Amari Cooper, cornerback Byron Jones, and linebacker Jaylon Smith. Although some of them may decide to wait until next offseason to sign, the point remains clear. It’s going to be extremely difficult for the Cowboys to keep all of them. This holds especially true if the Cowboys cave and give Prescott and Elliott record deals. Although they may be able to keep them all this season, having them wait until next offseason for a contract could hurt more than help. If they all have even better seasons, their price tag will likely increase. They’ll also have several other players they may need to pay in 2020 as well. The Cowboys seem to be facing a crossroads with their cap situation, and letting some key players go seems inevitable.

The same goes for a Le’Veon Bell style lockout.\xa0, \nAdding to the linebacking core\nOne of the Chargers biggest free agency concerns was improving their linebacking group. When free agency opened, that’s exactly what GM Tom Telesco did. He brought in Thomas Davis from Carolina and resigned Denzel Perryman to two year contracts of $10.5 and $12 million, respectively. While Davis wasn’t the biggest name out there or a huge difference maker, he’ll bring an impact player and flexibility to the linebacking position. Even at the age of 35, he was ranked the 19th LB in 2018 by Pro Football Focus.\xa0\nMeanwhile, Denzel Perryman will return to the middle linebacker position where he’s been a dominant force for LA during his four year career. He’s been a great clog in the running game and has seen consistent marks in his games. However, there is some injury risk with the resigning of Perryman. In his first 4 pro seasons, he’s yet to play a full year and only logged 16 games played over the past two seasons. While he’s a high ceiling player, Perryman needs to stay healthy and put up the same type of stats to make this a steal for the Chargers. Otherwise, paying $6 million a year for a player who’s only going to suit up for your team for half a season doesn’t seem like the best investment.\nBacking Up Philip Rivers?\nAfter backing up Phillip Rivers for one year, Geno Smith has departed and is now on the Seattle Seahawks. That left Cardale Jones as the Rivers’ backup and that front office quickly addressed that issue. Once Buffalo Bills starter Tyrod Taylor was brought in to shore up the backup spot with a two year, $11 million dollar contract.\xa0\nThough backup quarterbacks are usually nothing to be heralded about, Taylor brings an experienced QB that should be able to help out the team should anything happen to Rivers. In 3 starts with the Browns last season, Taylor was good for 473 passing yards and 2 TDs. However, he’s also a dual threat option and rushed for 125 yards and a TD in 2018. While Chargers fans likely won’t see much action from Taylor and probably won’t want to, he’ll be an experienced vet who the Chargers can depend on.\nWhat’s the deal with Melvin Gordon?\nPerhaps the biggest question surrounding the Chargers is the uncertainty around Melvin Gordon. Throughout his career, Gordon has been a great running back and was projected to be one of the best heading into this year. However, reports are that Gordon either wants a contract or out of Los Angeles as he appears to be taking the same path that Le’Veon Bell took last year. While this is obviously a very bad look not only for the Chargers but for the entire NFL, someone will have to budge.\xa0\nLos Angeles doesn’t have any commitment after this season and might not want to fork over a large sum of money. At the same time, it’s unlikely a playoff bound team would want to part with their best player ahead of a win-now season. It’ll be interesting to see exactly which direction the team decides to go when they contemplate whether to trade their star running back or risk losing him for nothing., One of the Chargers biggest free agency concerns was improving their linebacking group.

Things won’t get easier as they play in one of the toughest divisions with the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Green Bay Packers. Even with first round pick T.J. Hockenson looking like their next young star, there’s a lot of business left to do in the Motor City. In the offseason, they signed several depth position players as they’ll look to collectively get stronger instead of overpaying for one or two stars.\xa0, After a 6-10 finish last year, the Detroit Lions will look to get things back in order in another year with Head Coach Matt Patricia.

Hockenson looking like their next young star, there’s a lot of business left to do in the Motor City. In the offseason, they signed several depth position players as they’ll look to collectively get stronger instead of overpaying for one or two stars.\xa0, \nWho will emerge as Detroit’s top wideout\nAfter adding Danny Amendola in the offseason, the Lions face a problem many teams have at the wide receiver position. That question is, who can Detroit actually count on to become their top wideout. Amendola has been a fairly productive receiver in his career but never a #1 option. There isn’t too much room left to grow at his age and the breakout potential isn’t really there. He brings a veteran presence to the team but likely won’t finish in the top 2 for receptions.\nMarvin Jones remains a reliable option though he did struggle with injuries last year. He only suited up for 9 games but made the most out of that time. At that point, he accumulated 508 yards and 5 TDs and would’ve likely challenged for his second consecutive 1,000 receiving yard season if he wasn’t sidelined. Kenny Golladay was the Lions’ lead receiver with 1,063 receiving yards and 5 TDs. With Jones back in the picture, it remains to be seen whether Golladay will remain the #1 option or slot back to #2.\xa0\nWhat to expect from T.J. Hockenson\nThe tight end position was one of the weakest spots for the Lions in 2018. They quickly changed that by drafting T.J. Hockenson with the 8th overall pick in this year’s draft. In fact, that’s the highest a tight end has been taken since 2006 when Vernon Davis went #6 overall to the 49ers. That’s surely a high price to pay for the position but Hockenson is a special talent. He didn’t enter the year on anyone’s radar but by season’s end, he was the #1 TE prospect in the draft.\xa0\nIf he does pan out, Hockenson might be well worth the pick having been one of the best rated tight ends coming out of the draft in the past few years. He’s a great run blocker and only dropped two passes in his collegiate career. Out of training camp, the rookie has already impressed; he’s caught almost a dozen TDs and showed great athletic ability that will make him very successful. The ceiling is definitely high but Hockenson will have to prove his value one game day arrives. If he’s as good as advertised, we might be talking about Hockenson being a top 5 tight end by year’s end.\xa0\nCan Matthew Stafford carry the team once again\nThe Detroit Lions have only reached the playoffs 3 times in the Matthew Stafford era. Those were in 2011, 2014, and 2016. In each of those seasons, Stafford did something special. He set his career passing yards in a season in 2011, went to his first and only Pro Bowl in 2014, and led the NFL with 8 4th quarter comebacks in 2016. Since then, Stafford has been a good yet not great signal caller. The completion percentages have increased, the TD numbers have either remained constant or dropped, and the interceptions continue to be in the double digits yearly.\nIf the Lions want to reach the playoffs again, they’ll surely need their QB to play better. The Bears and Vikings defenses surely won’t be slowing down anytime soon and Aaron Rodgers is seeking another deep playoff run before retirement. There’s simply too much standing in Detroit’s way and if Stafford can’t improve and become elite, there’s not much hope. While he will get back Jones and the addition of Hockenson will help, Stafford must improve on his decision making and improve from the 50.8 QBR from last year., After adding Danny Amendola in the offseason, the Lions face a problem many teams have at the wide receiver position.

Personally, they’re one of my favorites to make some noise in the playoffs and should be a very dangerous team all around. Their offense was ranked 5th best while the defense came in 10th. They will look to make another deep playoff run after being knocked out by the Kansas City Chiefs last year. However, they did defeat the young Houston Texans so not all was lost.\xa0, With Andrew Luck healthy for a full season, the Indianapolis Colts went 10-6 and are poised to improve this season.

They will look to make another deep playoff run after being knocked out by the Kansas City Chiefs last year. However, they did defeat the young Houston Texans so not all was lost.\xa0, \nCan Andrew Luck hold up?\nAfter missing 26 games from 2015-17, Andrew Luck finally had a fully healthy season and made the most of it. When healthy, he was brilliant, passing for 4,593 yards and 39 TDs. For Luck, there’s never been a question about his skillset. The only problem with him is the injury history and whether he can actually stay on the field long enough to help the Colts. He had a career high in attempts last year and will likely look to top that with so many weapons.\xa0\nAdditionally, Luck’s completion rate was the highest of his career at 67.3% and he remained a dual threat with 148 rushing yards. The only thing concerning about Luck’s increased attempts is the interceptions. The 15 picks last year was clearly not favorable but easily overshadowed by his large TD numbers. He’s a great player that might need to see his playing time examined closely. Indianapolis simply can’t afford to lose him if they want to win the division this year.\xa0\nWhich receivers will stand out?\nThis offseason, the Colts made a flurry of moves at the wide receiver spot and made a strength even stronger. Last year, the Colts boasted one of the best receiving corps led by TY Hilton. This year, he’ll return to do more of the same though he will get some help. Joining him will be Devin Funchess, Parris Campbell, and Chester Rogers.\xa0\nWhile none of those names, besides Funchess, are especially appealing, it’s almost anyone’s guess as to who makes the cut. Hilton and Funchess are essentially locks to make it based on past reputation and are likely to occupy the two outside receiver spots. Among those still at camp, Campbell and Rogers are currently projected to be the #3 and #4 receivers on the roster. Both will have to be great and show some type of star quality to first make the roster and then become a starting wideout.\xa0\nWhat does Justin Houston bring to the team?\nAfter spending the entirety of his career in Kansas City, Justin Houston heads to Indianapolis on a 2 year, $24 million deal. This seemed almost like a steal for the Colts who now acquired their starting defensive end who was able to get 9 sacks in just 12 games last year. For his career, Houston has 78.5 sacks and even led the league in 2014 with 22. While he may no longer be an elite pass rusher, he’s plenty capable of applying pressure to the Qb and making smart plays.\xa0\nThe only reason the Colts got him was the large salary the Chiefs would’ve been forced to pay had they decided to keep him. Instead, the Colts got a steal here assuming Houson can still be anywhere close to the player he once was a few years back. At 30, Houston may not have a lot left in the tank but this is a win-win situation for both teams.

Many expected the NFC West to be up for grabs but I doubt many predicted the Rams to be this good. Led by Quarterback Jared Goff and Coach Sean McVay, the Rams were the 2nd best offense for all of last season. They still have Todd Gurley though there’s big concerns over his knee and whether he can be the same player going into this year. They’ll bring back a very skilled receiving corps with Cooper Kupp returning from injury and veterans Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods. Their defense was 20th ranked and featured a bunch of talented veterans and a great front line. However, they do have a holes at nose tackle, linebacker, and defensive back that will need some help.\xa0, The Los Angeles Rams were the talk of the NFL last season.

However, they do have a holes at nose tackle, linebacker, and defensive back that will need some help.\xa0, \nCan Clay Matthews still provide any value?\nClay Matthews brings another veteran presence to the Rams defense and will get the start at the outside linebacker spot. While he’s not the same player he was a few years ago, Matthews will return to his native home of LA and will play a big role for a team with high expectations. With only 3.5 sacks last year, Los Angeles will surely look for more after handing him a two year, $9.25 million dollar contract.\xa0\n\nMatthews will join a linebacker group that already consists of Dante Fowler, Samson Ebukam, and Cory Littleton. While mainly an edge rusher or outside linebacker with Green Bay, there’s a chance the Rams could ultimately place him in the middle linebacker spot. With Mark Barron gone, having Matthews in the middle of the group could make him the defensive quarterback with all his experience. While he might not have the same speed or physicality, Matthews will be a great presence in the LA defense and will solidify their linebacking group.\xa0\nDoes Eric Weddle upgrade the secondary?\nPerhaps the most notable addition for the Rams this offseason was the signing of veteran Eric Weddle. A longtime Charger, Weddle played out his last couple of years with Baltimore before ultimately inking a $10.5 million dollar contract for 2 years. Weddle’s got big shoes to fill in LaMarcus Joyner’s departure to Oakland but he’s surely the man to do it. Coming off his third consecutive Pro Bowl year, his streak of an interception per year finally ended in 2018. He’ll certainly look to start a new streak as he starts next to John Johnson III this year.\xa0\nAt the age of 34, Weddle should continue to be a major piece in the LA secondary that gave up a bunch of TDs in 2018. In the NFL, especially at the safety position, they’ll count on Weddle still having the legs to cover and run down receivers. While he might not have the same skillset as he had in the past, he’s another solid veteran addition to the secondary and will make for great help behind the Rams’ risk-seeking cornerbacks. Weddle and Jonson will make for a great back line behind Aquib Talib and Marcus Peters and should erase any mistakes the duo makes if they should gamble for interceptions.\xa0\nWhat's Todd Gurley's situation?\nLike all teams, the Rams are likely worried about their top player in Todd Gurley who didn’t look right at the end of last year. His injury prolonged into the playoffs and training camps this year. For the 2018 Rams, Gurley represented their primary weapon of attack. He amassed 1,251 rushing yards and 17 TDs in a monster season. However, he wasn’t very efficient in the latter part of the season as he only accrued 10 attempts in the Super Bowl after missing the past two months.\xa0\nIf Gurley can’t replicate his production from last year’s regular season, they’ll have to depend on Jared Goff having an MVP type season. From the latest reports, Gurley will likely be absent for most of training camp and will see minimal action during preseason games. Even if Gurley is the same player, the Rams will almost certainly hold back him touches in an attempt to get a productive season out of their All Pro running back for another deep playoff run. However, if the knee issues do linger, Gurley might not be able to even come close to his 2018 production., Clay Matthews brings another veteran presence to the Rams defense and will get the start at the outside linebacker spot. While he’s not the same player he was a few years ago, Matthews will return to his native home of LA and will play a big role for a team with high expectations. With only 3.5 sacks last year, Los Angeles will surely look for more after handing him a two year, $9.25 million dollar contract., Matthews will join a linebacker group that already consists of Dante Fowler, Samson Ebukam, and Cory Littleton.

However, he wasn’t very efficient in the latter part of the season as he only accrued 10 attempts in the Super Bowl after missing the past two months.\xa0, If Gurley can’t replicate his production from last year’s regular season, they’ll have to depend on Jared Goff having an MVP type season. From the latest reports, Gurley will likely be absent for most of training camp and will see minimal action during preseason games. Even if Gurley is the same player, the Rams will almost certainly hold back him touches in an attempt to get a productive season out of their All Pro running back for another deep playoff run. However, if the knee issues do linger, Gurley might not be able to even come close to his 2018 production.]""}}"

It’ll be interesting to see whether they rise to the challenge and repeat as division champs. To do so, they’ll have to answer these questions., \nHow Much Has Lamar Jackson Improved as a Passer?\nOne of the more interesting storylines last season was how the Ravens offense dramatically shifted once Lamar Jackson took over. It was clear there’d be some changes once Jackson replaced Flacco, but it really felt like the Ravens were inventing a new offensive style on the fly once Jackson became the man. Part of the reason their offense was so much more effective down the stretch was because of Lamar Jackson’s proficiency as a runner. He forced opposing defense to play completely differently than they were probably expecting to against the Ravens. However, defenders will likely be more prepared to stop him with a full offseason of preparation, so it’s critical Jackson evolves as well. One thing he absolutely must improve on is his passing game. That’s not to say he was horrible as a passer his rookie year but it’s clearly not a strength of his. If the Ravens truly want to become contenders, Jackson must take major strides forward as a passer.\nHow Good will Their Defense be Compared to Last Year?\nAlthough the Ravens quarterback controversy was what everyone was talking about last year, it was the Ravens defense that quietly kept the team afloat last season. While the offense was pretty inconsistent, ranging from dynamic and explosive to stale and uninteresting, the defense always stepped up when they were needed. This offseason brought about some changes to the Ravens defense, and it’s hard to say whether they’re better or worse for it. The team saw a lot of major contributors depart in free agency, from defensive lineman Za’Darius Smith, to linebackers Terrell Suggs and C.J. Mosley, and safety Eric Weddle. Conversely, the Ravens defense is extremely deep and full of talented youngsters who never got a chance to play before. They may not be as experienced, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be impactful. They also managed to make one high profile signing defensively by bringing in pro bowl safety Earl Thomas. The defense will look a lot different this season, but they still have a chance to be just as formidable.\nCan the Ravens Receivers Step Up?\nOne notable weak point for the Ravens is their lack of receiving depth. Although they drafted receiver Marquise Brown in the first round, they’re still pretty thin at the position. Two of their three leading receivers in terms of yardage from last season have departed, so a group that was already subpar last year may be even worse this year. Lamar Jackson’s development is a priority as a passer is a priority for the Ravens, so surrounding him with this group is less than desirable. It’s not completely hopeless however, as there’s hope Brown steps up right out of the gate or that they’re tight ends can pick up some of the slack. The Ravens are in a good situation with a starting caliber quarterback on a rookie deal, so there’s no better time to go for a championship then now, before he gets too expensive. But if they really want to make a run, they better have a plan to upgrade their receiving core or hope that one of them breaks out into a star., One of the more interesting storylines last season was how the Ravens offense dramatically shifted once Lamar Jackson took over.

The Falcons are in a pretty brutal division, but the potential for a deep playoff run remains. Here are some important questions about their roster heading into the season., \nHow Much of an Impact Will Their Returning Players Make?\nThe Falcons missed the playoffs in large part because they couldn’t even play one full game with all their starters fully healthy. They were besieged by injuries early in the year, with key players like safeties Ricardo Allen and Keanu Neal all suffering season ending injuries by week 3. Their starting left guard Andy Levitre suffered a season ending injury in week 2 as well. Starting linebacker Deion Jones and started running back Devonta Freeman also missed most of the regular season because of injury. The Falcons had some of the worst luck from injuries last year, but it’s unlikely fortune this bad strikes again this year. The Falcons have a chance to be one of the most significantly improved teams from last year by just getting so many core players back from injury. At the very least, their defense, which ranked 28th in yardage last year, should be much better.\nHow Much Help Can Their Two First Round Selections Provide?\nAlthough the Falcons offense was pretty potent last year, their offensive line was pretty subpar. The Falcons decided to make this a priority in their draft, as they selected offensive guard Chris Lindstrom with their first-round pick than traded up to select offensive tackle Kaleb McGary at the end of the first round. The Falcons will hope those two players, along with the return of their starting left guard, can transform their offensive line. Although Lindstrom and McGary are both rookies, it’s likely they’ll be asked to start right away. Whether they’re truly ready or not, they’ll be playing in meaningful games from the get-go, as this Falcons team is one that hopes to contend. Matt Ryan isn’t getting any younger, so the Falcons will likely play with urgency, knowing their super bowl window may be closing. Although McGary and Lindstrom are rookies, the Falcons likely drafted them thinking they’d be able to contribute right away, as they’d be unlikely to draft players that didn’t fit their timeline.\nWill the Falcons Offense be Better or Worse with Dirk Koetter?\nAfter a frustrating two seasons with offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian, that famously included a lot of red zone woes, the Falcons decided to replace him with former Buccaneers head coach Dirk Koetter. Koetter brings familiarity to the Falcons, as he was their offensive coordinator from 2012-2014. Although he was unable to find success on the Buccaneers, he still often led some quality offenses. It’s unlikely any offensive coordinator the Falcons get will be as good as Kyle Shanahan, who helped make the 2016 Falcons one of the best offenses in league history, but Koetter still should be an upgrade over Sarkisian. The Falcons have some of the best weapons in football, with arguably the best receiving core in the league. If the offense disappoints this season, it’ll likely be because Koetter fails to take advantage of the team’s talent. Dan Quinn is a solid coach but has never been a great offensive mind, which is why surrounding him with an elite, creative offensive coordinator is important.

This season, they’ll once again open as underdogs in the division and likely to embark on a rebuild.

They didn’t sign any significant names in free agency but instead, let a majority of their stars walk in an effort to play younger guys and build a team for the future.\xa0, \nWhat can the Dolphins expect from Fitzpatrick?\nPrior to acquiring Josh Rosen, Miami secured Ryan Fitzpatrick on a 2 year, $11 million deal that will likely prove to be a bargain. Fitzpatrick was the ideal backup in Tampa Bay and had one of the best stretches during the early part of last year. Filling in for Jameis Winston, he eventually started 7 out of 8 games and completed a career high 66.7% of passes and 17 TDs. However, those numbers did come at the cost of 12 interceptions as Fitzpatrick constantly tried to play hero ball and use the aerial attack to keep the Bucs in the game.\nComing to Miami, Fitzpatrick will be expected to be a mentor and the bridge quarterback until Rosen is ready to see game action. He’s the projected opening starter and will likely remain at that spot until Rosen is deemed ready or an unforeseen injury occurs. Fitzpatrick is a decent signal caller but by no means a quarterback the Dolphins hope to keep around for the long haul. Instead, expect Fitzpatrick to stick around for at least this season and potentially traded in the offseason if Rosen is named the starter for next year.\xa0\nIs Josh Rosen a franchise QB?\nWith the #1 overall pick in the draft, the Arizona Cardinals had a few different directions they could go. Eventually, they selected Kyler Murray which meant Josh Rosen would be relegated to backup duties in the early part of his career. In an effort to return some value on their former first round pick rather than see his prime years go to waste on the bench, the Dolphins swapped a second round pick in exchange for his services. While Rosen has yet to find much success at the NFL level, he’s a potentially high reward option at Qb that could eventually become Miami’s franchise signal caller in the next year or two.\xa0\nEven if he busts, Rosen remains on a rookie deal at one of the highest paid positions in the league. In his first year, Rosen saw starting action in 13 games but failed to do much in those contests. The 3-10 record surely aren’t inspiring but in an Arizona offense that saw a dip in production from the RB spot and the only solid receiver in Larry Fitzgerald, Rosen wasn’t too bad. He’ll surely have to work on his completion percentage and decision making that saw him complete 55.2% of passes and a 11-13 TD/INT ratio.\xa0\nWhy let all the big names go?\nWhile most teams spent money trying to upgrade their roster and become better than last season, the 8-8 Dolphins took a different approach. They let franchise veterans Ryan Tannehill, Cameron Wake, and Ja’Wuan James all walk, among others. They then proceeded to bring in a pair of quarterbacks, Eric Rowe, and Dwayne Allen to fill those holes in the lineup. First off, that’s clearly a lot of talent being lost in those names and the players being brought in aren’t exactly household names.\xa0\nWhile there’s going to be some talented players on the field next year, Miami is undoubtedly going to be one of the worst teams in the league. They simply lack the firepower to compete with their divisional foes and don’t have enough established pieces to make a playoff run.

At the midseason mark, they were 6-2 and seemed poised to contend with the Saints for the NFC South. Unfortunately, their season wet up in flames immediately after, as the Panthers finished the season 1-7 to finish with a 7-9 record and missed the playoffs.

At the midseason mark, they were 6-2 and seemed poised to contend with the Saints for the NFC South. Unfortunately, their season wet up in flames immediately after, as the Panthers finished the season 1-7 to finish with a 7-9 record and missed the playoffs. This Panthers roster is still talented, and they have a quality coach in Ron Rivera, but if they want to get back into contention they’ll need to answer some serious questions. Here are some of the biggest., \nIs Cam Newton Truly 100% Healthy?\nThis is probably one of the biggest questions not only for the team, but for the entire league. A massive reason the Panthers collapsed down the stretch was due to the sudden downturn in Cam Newton’s play. Newton looked like he was having his best year since his MVP season, but a shoulder injury clearly hampered him down the stretch, and he missed the last game of the season. Newton had offseason shoulder surgery and according to the Panthers, is ready to play. Still, there’s plenty of reason for outside skepticism. A big reason there’s a lot of doubt is because of Cam’s troubling injury history. This isn’t the first time he’s suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery, so there are already questions about his shoulder’s durability. Couple in the fact that Andrew Luck just sat out an entire season recovering from a similar injury, you have a plenty of reason to worry for Cam. When healthy, he’s one of the best quarterbacks in the game, but if he’s hurt, the Panthers aren't going anywhere. The Panthers should be honest with themselves, and realize letting him play through an injury would be a mistake both now and for the future.\nIs the Rest of the Panther’s Offense Good Enough?\nAlthough most of the worry is reserved for Newton, there are still concerns for the rest of the Panther’s offense. Namely, is the supporting cast around Newton super bowl caliber? There are some pretty big positives; the Panthers offensive line has always been solid and will likely continue to be this year, and Christian McCaffrey appears to be a bonafide superstar. Greg Olsen when healthy is one of the league’s best tight ends and has a strong rapport with Newton. However, there are some problematic negatives as well. For one, Olsen hasn’t been healthy in a couple years, as he’s only played in half of the games possible for the last two seasons. The Panthers receiving depth is also lacking, as most of their receivers are either unproven or past their prime. The closest thing they have to a WR1 is second year player D.J. Moore, who had an encouraging rookie year with the team but has still never had a 1000-yard season. Overall, there are a lot of pros and cons for this Panthers offense, and the pendulum could swing either way depending on how much their young players grow and their injury luck.\nWhat Will the Panthers’ Defense Look Like Entering the Season?\nAlthough much of the attention is on the Panthers’ offense, their defense has some questions it needs to answer as well. For one, there appears to be a lot of moving parts and things up in the air right now. The starting free safety job is yet to be determined, and they have two defensive starters with contract negotiations they’d probably like to wrap up. Those starters are Shaq Thompson and James Bradberry, the team’s starting linebacker and cornerback respectively. The team has also reportedly started to shift from a 4-3 defensive scheme to a 3-4 scheme, something that’s surprising considering how long Ron Rivera used the 4-3. The point is, there are a lot of things in flux for the Panthers’ defense, and a lot of things are likely subject to change. The defense may have some things set in stone, like Luke Kuechly’s starting position, but others are less certain. Hopefully the Panthers will get a grasp on the personnel and scheme they’re most confident in before the season starts., This is probably one of the biggest questions not only for the team, but for the entire league. A massive reason the Panthers collapsed down the stretch was due to the sudden downturn in Cam Newton’s play. Newton looked like he was having his best year since his MVP season, but a shoulder injury clearly hampered him down the stretch, and he missed the last game of the season. Newton had offseason shoulder surgery and according to the Panthers, is ready to play. Still, there’s plenty of reason for outside skepticism. A big reason there’s a lot of doubt is because of Cam’s troubling injury history. This isn’t the first time he’s suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery, so there are already questions about his shoulder’s durability. Couple in the fact that Andrew Luck just sat out an entire season recovering from a similar injury, you have a plenty of reason to worry for Cam. When healthy, he’s one of the best quarterbacks in the game, but if he’s hurt, the Panthers aren't going anywhere. The Panthers should be honest with themselves, and realize letting him play through an injury would be a mistake both now and for the future., Although most of the worry is reserved for Newton, there are still concerns for the rest of the Panther’s offense. Namely, is the supporting cast around Newton super bowl caliber? There are some pretty big positives; the Panthers offensive line has always been solid and will likely continue to be this year, and Christian McCaffrey appears to be a bonafide superstar. Greg Olsen when healthy is one of the league’s best tight ends and has a strong rapport with Newton. However, there are some problematic negatives as well. For one, Olsen hasn’t been healthy in a couple years, as he’s only played in half of the games possible for the last two seasons. The Panthers receiving depth is also lacking, as most of their receivers are either unproven or past their prime. The closest thing they have to a WR1 is second year player D.J. Moore, who had an encouraging rookie year with the team but has still never had a 1000-yard season. Overall, there are a lot of pros and cons for this Panthers offense, and the pendulum could swing either way depending on how much their young players grow and their injury luck., Although much of the attention is on the Panthers’ offense, their defense has some questions it needs to answer as well. For one, there appears to be a lot of moving parts and things up in the air right now. The starting free safety job is yet to be determined, and they have two defensive starters with contract negotiations they’d probably like to wrap up. Those starters are Shaq Thompson and James Bradberry, the team’s starting linebacker and cornerback respectively. The team has also reportedly started to shift from a 4-3 defensive scheme to a 3-4 scheme, something that’s surprising considering how long Ron Rivera used the 4-3. The point is, there are a lot of things in flux for the Panthers’ defense, and a lot of things are likely subject to change. The defense may have some things set in stone, like Luke Kuechly’s starting position, but others are less certain. Hopefully the Panthers will get a grasp on the personnel and scheme they’re most confident in before the season starts.]""}}"

They went 12-4 and won the NFC north division for the first time since 2010. Their defense was one of the best in the league, racking up an absurd number of takeaways, while franchise quarterback Mitch Trubisky showed impressive growth in his first year under Matt Nagy.

The potential for a deep playoff run is still there, but they’ll have to answer these questions first., \nWill the Bears Defense Be Just as Elite as Last Season?\nThe Bears defense was an absolute juggernaut last year, shutting down almost everyone they played. They were talented before the Khalil Mack trade, but adding him to their squad put them on a whole new level of dominance. Although they lost a couple pieces in free agency, they also gained some new pieces, and the majority of their defensive core remains intact. Still, there’s reason to think they might take a step back this season. For one, they lost defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who became the Broncos head coach. This is a pretty big blow, as Fangio was the mastermind of the Bears defensive scheme and was a veteran coach that had the respect of his players. Replacing him is easier said than done. It’s also likely that the Bears won’t be able to replicate the amount of turnovers they forced last year. Takeaways are often a volatile stat that lacks consistency, and it’s probable that the numbers of takeaways the Bears force this year will trend back to the league average. The Bears defense will likely still be elite, but it’s hard to see them being as historically dominant as they were last year.\nCan Mitch Trubisky Take Another Step Forward?\nSimilar to his good friend Jared Goff, Trubisky took a big leap forward his sophomore season under better coaching, after struggling his rookie season. With another year in Nagy’s system, there’s hope that he can be better even better next year. Something that got lost in all the hype around the Bears last season was that their offense wasn’t actually that good, ranking just 21st in total yards. If the Bears want to hit a new level, their offense will need to get on the same level as their defense. To do that, Trubisky must take the next step from solid starter to star. Trubisky has a pretty solid supporting cast, so there really isn’t an excuse for him to stagnate this season. He was drafted 2nd overall for a reason, and it’s time he starts playing up to his potential as a star player.\nWho’s Their New Kicker Going Forward?\nFor all of last season, the Bears only had one critical, major weakness. That was their kicker, Cody Parkey, and he arguably ended up costing the Bears their season with his missed field goal at the end of the wild card game. He was unceremoniously cut shortly after, and the Bears have been looking to find a replacement since. It wasn’t a great sign when the Bears entered the minicamps with 3 kickers, and even though that number has been cut down to 2, that still isn’t ideal. Anytime a team has more than 1 kicker on their roster, it’s unlikely it’s for a good reason. Right now, it appears that the kicking battle is coming between Eddy Pineiro and Elliot Fry. Regardless of who they choose, the decision must be made within a month (before the season begins) and it has to be someone they’re comfortable and confident in going forward.

A team that was once dominant only a few years ago, the window seems to be quickly closing around the Seahawks being a force in the NFC. They have a strong team, but not too strong, and while they may continue to make the playoffs for a few more years, I don't see them putting anything substantial together in the postseason for some time. Having the Rams in their division certainly doesn't help, but what will help them get 4 automatic wins are the 49ers and Cardinals also being in the NFC West, which could in turn help them grab another wild-card bid this season., Last season, the Seahawks went 10-6 and secured a wild-card spot.

For starters, Wilson has without a doubt become the face of this franchise. As long as Wilson is manning the helm, fans are going to be happy. He's been there on the Seahawks when they've been a juggernaut, and while many of the pieces that helped them achieve that status have since gone different directions, he's still there as a top quarterback in the league. I don't fault Seattle for wanting to build their team around him, and it certainly beats betting on a quarterback in the draft and him ultimately flopping.\nWhat is the current situation with RDT Jarran Reed?\nDue to a reported incident of domestic violence in 2017, Jarran Reed will be forced by the NFL to sit out the first six games of the NFL season. With Reed having 10.5 sacks last year for the Seahawks, it'll be a huge blow for them. He had the second most sacks on the team behind only Frank Clark, who was traded to the Chiefs in the offseason. Without Reed for the first six games of the season, the Seahawks are forced to rely on free agent signing Ziggy Ansah and first round pick L.J. Collier to get a solid pass rush going. While the argument can be made that Seattle's defense is still strong and will persevere through his absence, some of the teams they play in their first six games include the Steelers, Saints, and Rams. His absence will certainly be felt in those matchups.\nDo the Seahawks have a strong enough roster to return to the postseason this year?\nIn short, yes, I think they do. While many of their most well-known players in franchise history have parted ways with the team in the last couple of offseasons, the Seahawks still have a good enough defense and an offense manned by superstar QB Russell Wilson. There's a reason the Seahawks currently have 5 primetime games on their schedule: fans and people around the league see them as an exciting team to watch, mainly because of Russell Wilson and his ability to navigate opposing defenses with ease.

With that being said, this Browns roster, particularly on offense, is stacked. There are some questions about their offensive line (more on that later) but at the skill positions, there may not be a better team in the league. At receiver, the Browns have superstar Odell Beckham Jr. on one side of the field and his best friend, pro bowl receiver Jarvis Landry on the other. It feels like overkill to have promising young receiver Antonio Callaway as the WR3 on this team. The Browns also have one of the more impressive young tight ends in the game at David Njoku, who will look to build off a strong sophomore season where he had over 600 yards receiving. At running back, they just added Kareem Hunt to a position that already had Nick Chubb and Duke Johnson Jr. Hunt may have character issues and will have to serve an 8-game suspension for his actions last year, but his talent is undeniable. Chubb and Johnson Jr. are both players proved themselves worthy of big roles last season, so having them as a RB2 and RB3 is almost unfair.\nCan the Cleveland Defense Take the Next Step?\nWhile the Cleveland defense wasn’t downright awful last season, it was still below average, ranking 21st in points allowed. They’ve made some changes defensively, trading away promising safety Jabrill Peppers but acquiring defensive end Oliver Vernon and defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson. Losing Peppers hurts their secondary, but Richardson and Vernon bring a veteran presence to the defensive line that was missing before. The Browns have a new defensive coordinator this year, so that also throws a new wrinkle in the Brown's defense. They do have some big pieces defensively, most notably cornerback Denzel Ward and defensive end Myles Garrett, who will look to build off strong rookie and sophomore season respectively. A lot of the focus is on the Browns offense, but how the Browns defense fares will be an equally important factor in Cleveland's performance this season. \nWill the Browns Offensive Line Hold Them Back?\nThe Browns offensive line has undergone some pretty seismic changes in the past couple season. First was the retirement of franchise mainstay Joe Thomas at the end of the 2017 season, then was the trading of right guard Kevin Zeitler, who performed admirably last year. The Browns offensive line appears to be in flux, with Zeitler’s replacement in particular being a big headline at training camp. The Browns do at least have pro bowl left guard Joel Bitonio, who will ensure the Browns offensive line has a certain floor. There are concerns at seemingly every other position, however. Although Greg Robinson looked solid at left tackle for the Browns last year, there’s a reason he’s considered one of the biggest busts in NFL history. Right tackle Chris Hubbard was very inconsistent in his debut season last year and although center J.C. Tretter played well, he battled ankle issues last season so health may be a factor for him. The Browns enter this season with hope and promise, but the offensive line could wind up holding the team back if things go south., Chemistry is an underrated part of a team, and without it, the talent of a team becomes irrelevant.

I see this deal being a win for both clubs, as Brown's time with the Steelers was more than up, and he needed a change of scenery. An All-Pro receiver can never hurt a team, though, and I believe he'll bring a lot of value to the Raiders on offense. That being said, Juju Smith-Schuster and Donte Moncrief will be expected to step up this year to carry the load Brown left behind. Despite all the drama surrounding Brown with the Steelers, he still performed incredible Bly well on the field and leaves a huge hole in his absence, with the Steelers and Roethlisberger having gotten used to having him lining up on their side.\nWhat can we expect from the Steelers offensive line this year?\nAs of now, there are four spots on the Steelers offensive line that appear to be set in stone. It's currently David DeCastro at right guard, Maurkice Pouncey at center, Ramon Foster at left guard, and Alejandro Villanueva at left tackle. Between the four of them, they have 13 Pro Bowls and are thought of as the core pieces of one of the best pass-blocking lines in the NFL. BUT, the right tackle position and backup lineman spots are not yet defined. As of now, it seems like the completion is between Matt Feiler Chukwuma Okorafor. Feiler started 10 games last year and held his own, but he'll have to continue to prove himself in the pre-season if he wants to secure a starting spot in the first game of the season.\nWill we see less passing production from Roethlisberger this season?\nWhile there's no way to know for sure, I certainly think there will be a large drop off in Big Ben's passing yards this year. He posted a hefty 5,129 passing yards last year, but I don't think he'll get close to that again this year. First, he's getting up there in age. Father Time has, time and time again, shown he's undefeated (except maybe in the case of Brady and Brees). Just watching him play recently, you can tell his arm doesn't quite have the zip it used to. With Brown no longer on the team, he loses one of his main targets. While other receivers on the Steelers are still strong, I simply don't think Tomlin and the coaching staff are going to expect Big Ben to throw the ball that much this year. Instead, I think they'll rely more on the run game and short passes., The Antonio Brown saga finally came to an end this offseason with the Steelers shipping him off the the Raiders for a third and fifth round draft pick. I see this deal being a win for both clubs, as Brown's time with the Steelers was more than up, and he needed a change of scenery. An All-Pro receiver can never hurt a team, though, and I believe he'll bring a lot of value to the Raiders on offense. That being said, Juju Smith-Schuster and Donte Moncrief will be expected to step up this year to carry the load Brown left behind.

Green is the rare wide receiver that is likely the most indispensable player on his team’s offense. So, it was a brutal blow to see him go down in training camp. According to most diagnostics, he’s likely to miss the beginning the season. Obviously this is better than a season ending injury, but even then, this injury might have already killed the Bengals chances. The Bengals open their season with a pretty difficult stretch. They’ll have to face the Seahawks, 49ers, Bills, and Steelers to open their season, and three of the four games will be on the road. Both the Seahawks and Steelers are two teams widely viewed as playoff caliber, while the Bills and 49ers are both considered teams on the rise that are playoff sleepers. It’s very likely that the Bengals might start off the season 1-3 or even 0-4. That would effectively kill their chances to make the playoffs. For a team already considered mediocre with Green, having to play any stretch of the season without him is going to be extremely difficult.\nHow Improved is Their Offensive Line?\nThe Bengals offensive line was pretty dreadful last season, and it was part of the reason the Bengals season fell apart after a strong start. Unfortunately, it seems that not much will be changing from last season personnel wise. The Bengals seemed to make a major acquisition for their offensive line when they drafted Jonah Williams 11th, but he tore his labrum and will likely miss all of this season. The Bengals will be hoping that better health for their offensive line will improve their peformance. Two players on the unit, Cordy Glenn and Billy Price, both struggled with injuries last year so there’s hope that they’ll be better operating at full strength. Even then, there are some major concerns, especially at left guard. It’s concerning that the Bengals have yet to decide who their starter will be at that position. Chemistry is a big part for an offensive line, so the more the Bengals wait to decide who will be the left guard, the less time the offensive line will get to mesh. It’s likely the Bengals offensive line plays slightly better than they did last year, but expecting a major leap is foolhardy.\nWill Tyler Eifert Finally Stay Healthy This Year?\nTyler Eifert has been one of the most injury prone players in the league. He’s missed a whopping 34 combined games in the past 3 seasons, more than 70 percent of the total games played. It’s particularly frustrating because when Eifert’s been healthy, he’s been pretty productive. In his last mostly healthy season in 2015, Eifert scored 13 touchdowns and had more than 600 receiving yards. When he plays, he adds a new dimension to the Bengals offense and helps give their passing game more variety. That hasn’t happened in a while unfortunately. If the Bengals truly want to be competitive this year, having Eifert fully healthy and able to contribute is a must, as they’ll need all the help they can get to even stay afloat in their own division., A.J.

Their main upgrades in free agency came in the form of both offensive and defensive linemen to tighten up the ship.

Will this year be a repeat of the Titans falling just short of a playoff spot or will they push through and emerge victorious amidst a tough AFC South?, \nWhat can we expect from Marcus Mariota this season?\n\nDespite finishing at a record of 9-7 last season, the Titans' offense still wasn't very strong. They ranked 27th in points/game and 25th in yards/game which is unusual for a team that missed the playoffs by one game. Mariota was thought to be QB18 in fantasy circles before last season and ended up dropping to QB23 by the time the season was over. Him being injured and missing two games certainly didn't help his cause, but it seems like he has a real shot of a breakout season this year. His completion percentage was up last year but his QBR still fell short of his 96.6 he earned in 2016. This will be his fifth season with the Titans and in the NFL, so it's likely that what we see from him this year will be what he'll ever be capable of achieving as an NFL QB.\n\nWill the Titans D stay a top 10 defense in the NFL this season?\n\nDespite losing Orakpo to retirement in the offseason, I still think the Titans will put out a very strong defense this year. Since their offense doesn't have a track record of being very strong, they will need their defense to be elite if they want a chance at grabbing a playoff spot. Malcom Butler will be coming off his best season to date in which he ranked second in forced incompletion rate in red-zone coverage. Jurrell Casey will be a part of the Titans again this season. He recorded an impressive 44 pressures last year, so getting him back was huge for the Titans. Overall, the defense looks very similar to how it did last year, so I don't see it slipping out of the top 10.\n\nWhat's different offensively for the Titans this season?\n\nFirst off, the Titans signed Adam Humphries from Tampa Bay who will be lining up alongside Corey Davis and A.J. Brown. This gives Mariota an additional solid target to throw to which will be big in improving upon the struggling offense from last season. On top of this, Corey Davis improved greatly last year from his rocky rookie year. He finished 30th overall in first down receptions with 42. He'll likely continue to improve as he gets set for his third year in the NFL. RB1 Derrick Henry averaged 4.9 yards per carry last year, but seemed to be on a steady upward trend as the year progressed. Hopefully for the Titans he'll get out to a hot start and maintain that throughout the year.]""}}"

He’s got the potential to be one of the best in the game and could easily be a top 5 RB by season’s end. In the past, defenses could cater their schemes into stopping him by stacking the box.

During the draft, the implemented a rich gets richer strategy and drafted Josh Allen, not to be mistaken with the Buffalo Bills quarterback with the same name, with the 7th overall pick in this past draft. While many projected Allen could go anywhere from 3-6, he instead fell to the Bills at 7 and will immediately give them another great pass rusher. Whether you want him to pressure the quarterback, stop running backs, or drop back in coverage, he can do it all.\xa0\nJacksonville’s front four should be a force to be reckoned with.

The five of them should form a very solid core that will once again make the Jaguars one of the best defenses in the league.\xa0\nIs Nick Foles finally the answer?\nBlake Bortles struggled as a quarterback for the majority of his career and was likely seen as a stopgap until they found their franchise starter.

In a full season as a starter, I’d easily project him for a 3,500 passing yard season with 24 TDs.

It marked the second season in a row where the Giants finished at the bottom of the NFC East, and after the offseason they had, I wouldn't be surprised if this year marks the third consecutive season they're on the bottom of the East. They seem to be in the midst of a rebuild, so it makes sense, but a rebuild unfortunately means there won't be too great of football coming out of MetLife Stadium this year., After another disappointing season for the Giants last year (finished 5-11), things unfortunately don't seem like they're going to turn around this year. It marked the second season in a row where the Giants finished at the bottom of the NFC East, and after the offseason they had, I wouldn't be surprised if this year marks the third consecutive season they're on the bottom of the East. They seem to be in the midst of a rebuild, so it makes sense, but a rebuild unfortunately means there won't be too great of football coming out of MetLife Stadium this year., \nWhy in the world did the Giants trade Odell Beckham Jr.?\nWhen you're looking at this trade, it's imperative to keep in mind the fact that the Giants are in rebuild mode. Well, why wouldn't they keep a young generational talent like Beckham as a core member of the team and build around him? That's a good question. I guess you could look at the fact that Beckham has missed a little over a quarter of career games due to injury which really doesn't look good when trying to put a value on the wide receiver. After all was said in done, the Giants effectively traded Beckham for DL Dexter Lawrence (17th overall in the 2019 Draft), LB Oshane Ximines (third-round pick in the 2019 Draft), and safety Jabrill Peppers. As with most trades, only time will tell if it proves to be worth it. If the Giants are going to be rebuilding, young(er) talent is what they need, and getting two extra draft picks this year will certainly help their cause.\nHow does QB Daniel Jones fit into this Giants team?\nAgain, you have to be thinking future when looking into this draft-pick. With the Giants dealing Odell Beckham Jr. to Cleveland, it afforded them the opportunity to draft a QB and still get first round defensive talent in Dexter Lawrence. It's one of those things where the Giants eventually had to bite the bullet and draft who they think will be the aging Eli Manning's replacement. With the current trend of Brees and Brady playing into their forties, it's hard to say exactly when Eli Manning will hang up the towel. It should be noted, though, that he'll be a free agent after this year, and what happens in the offseason will be the main determinant of what is to be with Daniel Jones. Jones has a similar build to Eli, but at first glance appears to be much more athletic. You have to admit that the Giants have a type, but they're really hoping Jones will be their guy for years to come.\nWhy did the Giants let Landon Collins walk?\nThis is, again, a move for the future. While at first glance it seems like a boneheaded move to let the leader of their secondary and 3x Pro-Bowler Collins walk, when you look at the bigger picture, it starts to make more sense. Applying the franchise tag to Collins would only lead to a huge salary given out later, and the Giants simply felt that money would be put to better use in other places. They're going to eventually need to resign Barkley, after all. Whether it was the right or wrong move isn't really for me to say, but rather it was a decision the Giants made. Jabrill Peppers will make a strong replacement for Collins, though., When you're looking at this trade, it's imperative to keep in mind the fact that the Giants are in rebuild mode. Well, why wouldn't they keep a young generational talent like Beckham as a core member of the team and build around him? That's a good question. I guess you could look at the fact that Beckham has missed a little over a quarter of career games due to injury which really doesn't look good when trying to put a value on the wide receiver. After all was said in done, the Giants effectively traded Beckham for DL Dexter Lawrence (17th overall in the 2019 Draft), LB Oshane Ximines (third-round pick in the 2019 Draft), and safety Jabrill Peppers. As with most trades, only time will tell if it proves to be worth it. If the Giants are going to be rebuilding, young(er) talent is what they need, and getting two extra draft picks this year will certainly help their cause., Again, you have to be thinking future when looking into this draft-pick. With the Giants dealing Odell Beckham Jr. to Cleveland, it afforded them the opportunity to draft a QB and still get first round defensive talent in Dexter Lawrence. It's one of those things where the Giants eventually had to bite the bullet and draft who they think will be the aging Eli Manning's replacement. With the current trend of Brees and Brady playing into their forties, it's hard to say exactly when Eli Manning will hang up the towel. It should be noted, though, that he'll be a free agent after this year, and what happens in the offseason will be the main determinant of what is to be with Daniel Jones. Jones has a similar build to Eli, but at first glance appears to be much more athletic. You have to admit that the Giants have a type, but they're really hoping Jones will be their guy for years to come., This is, again, a move for the future. While at first glance it seems like a boneheaded move to let the leader of their secondary and 3x Pro-Bowler Collins walk, when you look at the bigger picture, it starts to make more sense. Applying the franchise tag to Collins would only lead to a huge salary given out later, and the Giants simply felt that money would be put to better use in other places. They're going to eventually need to resign Barkley, after all. Whether it was the right or wrong move isn't really for me to say, but rather it was a decision the Giants made. Jabrill Peppers will make a strong replacement for Collins, though.]""}}"

For Rodgers, the only experienced targets will be Devante Adams and Jimmy Graham while the running game will once again be a committee.\xa0, \nHow many running backs does Green Bay need?\nAs it currently projects, the Packers will open the year with five backs on their roster. While they’ll certainly run the ball, that’s surely a large amount of players to carry at that single position. Aaron Jones is the clear #1 option and is sure to get plenty of touches after leading the team in rushing yards in 2018. Jamaal Williams is also slated to get a fair share of action after receiving the second most rushing attempts last season.\nBeyond the 1,2 punch, Dexter Williams and Corey Grant may play deeper reserve roles on the team. All four running backs are capable of making an impact though they might not get enough time to do so. Expect Jones and Williams to do most of the running with Williams and Grant to place further on the depth chart. They might even get a shot on special teams and I wouldn’t be surprised if one of them ends up being cut. Danny Vitale will likely remain on the roster as the lone fullback and might get a few touches throughout the year.\xa0\nWhat to expect from the new look safeties\nIt’s always nice to make your team better in free agency but perhaps better if that move also hurts your rivals. That’s exactly what the Packers did when they inked Adrian Amos to a deal and took him away from the Chicago Bears. Amos was a solid contributor for the Bears defense that was by far the best in the league last year and will hope to help the Packers solidify their secondary this season. He’s a nice 26 year old player that will likely shore up the free safety spot for years to come.\xa0\nMeanwhile, rookie Darnell Savage has yet to suit up for practice but is likely going to have a shot at the opposite starting gig. Besides that, Raven Greene is likely to compete against Savage for the starting job as he’s been playing with the first unit in Savage’s absence. Josh Jones remains the final player who’s got a chance to be a versatile piece coming off the sidelines. He’s currently seeing time at the linebacker position and remains a player on the bubble of the roster.\nIs Aaron Rodgers still elite?\nA year ago, this wouldn’t even be a question. Throughout his career, Rodgers has been one of the most consistent QBs that is clearly aimed as a first ballot Hall of Famer. After an injury riddled season in 2017, Aaron Rodgers returned to prime form and threw for 4,442 yards and 25 TDs in 2018. His accuracy and decision making was on point as he completed 62.3% of passes and amazingly, only threw 2 picks. While he did pay safer, he also wasn’t very effective at finding targets in the end zone.\nLast season, Rodgers’ QBR of 56.8 was his worst since becoming a starter. While he was a more careful passer and limited his damage through the air, he also didn’t do enough to help his team win. Another problem was the constant pressure he faced as he was sacked 49 times last year. That likely kept Rodgers scrambling in the box and unable to find much rhythm in game action. He’s trending down but the future HOF QB likely has a few good seasons left in the tank., As it currently projects, the Packers will open the year with five backs on their roster.

Adam Gase is the head coach and was the interim GM until they hired Joe Douglas. A slew of offseason moves seems to put the Jets, at the very least, in a place to do better than they did last year., \nWhat does Le'Veon Bell bring to this Jets team?\nFor starters, any time you can get a top running back talent to sign with your team in free agency it's usually a good thing. In a contract that ended up being less than what the Steelers were offering but $2 million more in guaranteed money, Le'Veon Bell and the Jets will have a working relationship for the next four years.

Bell comes to Jets in what is supposed to be a turning point for the team, with him as one of the main centerpieces. If he is able to put up numbers similar to or better than what he was able to do with the Steelers, it'll be a win for both sides. \nWhat were other key offseason signing besides Bell?\nGoing into this offseason, one of the Jets' biggest needs was a wide receiver. Crowder fit that bill and signed with the Jets for three years. Having him as a receiver simply gives Darnold more options and allows for some of the pressure to be taken off of Anderson and Enunwa. It's not the best wide receiver core in the league, but it's certainly better than what the Jets were putting out there last season. Another big signing for the Jets was middle linebacker C.J. Mosely. After spending the last five seasons with the Ravens, Mosely will be suiting up in a new uniform for the first time. He certainly adds a lot to this Jets defense, especially in the face of losing one of its best pieces in Buster Skrine. \nHow are the Jets predicted to do this season?\nAs of now, the Jets are nowhere near being picked as favorites or even likely to win the Super Bowl. They're, once again, slated to finish behind the New England Patriots in the AFC East. That being said, the Jets being picked as finishing second in the East is a huge leap from finishing dead last in the 2018/19 campaign. If what is predicted comes to fruition, that'll mean the Jets have to earn their post-season berth in the form of a wild card spot, which seems less than likely with some of the other teams the AFC has to offer that seem slightly more qualified. Stranger things have happened, though, and all it takes is Darnold having a breakout second season and some players to step up on both sides of the ball.

McCoy had a career worst year and at 31, may not have much left in the tank to give. Many people expected him to be traded or released, and then replaced in the offseason. Well that’s what seemed to be happening when the Bills acquired running backs Frank Gore and T.J. Yeldon, yet the Bills still decided to hold on to LeSean McCoy. This was a confusing move considering that they brought in two running backs in the offseason, but the Bills apparently plan to use him in their offense. He’s clearly not the long-term answer for the Bills, and his trade value will likely only go down as he gets older. The Bills have been viewed as a dysfunctional franchise for decades and although they’ve made a couple moves that would seem to indicate progress, confusing decisions like this only reinforce that belief. \nDoes Josh Allen Have Enough Support?\nThe Bills appear to have finally found their long-term answer at quarterback with Josh Allen, who showed flashes of stardom last year. He’s still incredibly raw however, so making sure he has a quality supporting cast that can make his development easier is important. Whether the Bills have that supporting cast is yet to be determined. They appear to have some pieces in their receiving game, with Zay Jones, Robert Foster, and John Brown providing some solid young options for Allen. There might be too many running backs on the team, but at the very least, it’s still better to have too many options than too little. Tyler Kroft was a nice pick up at tight end in the offseason for the Bills. The offensive line, however, is where things get tricky. Last year the Bills offensive line was one of the worst in football, a unit that essentially had Josh Allen running for his life the majority of passing plays. The Bills decided to revamp almost the entire unit this offseason, with 4 out of the 5 linemen being first time starters on the team. Whether this change improves things remains to be seen, but it’s hard to see them being worse than last year’s unit.\nWhat Are Realistic Expectations for This Team?\nAlthough the Bills have assembled a respectable roster, it’s still unlikely they challenge the Patriots in their division. The wild card is a slightly more attainable goal, but even that will be difficult for this squad. The Bills have appeared to assemble the majority of their young core, so the first phase of rebuilding, gathering players, should be done. The second phase should be developing the assets they have. Although making the playoffs would be wonderful for that, it’s important to keep perspective for this team. It’s still a very young one that still needs a little more time to nurture. The Bills should of course be trying to make the playoffs, but they should also keep their expectations grounded in reality.

The main features include Lamar Miller at running back and DeAndre Hopkins at wide receiver. The defense is also similar with only a slight change at the safety position.\xa0, \nIs DeAndre Hopkins the best receiver in the league?\nAfter making the Pro Bowl for the second year in a row, it’s questionable whether DeAndre Hopkins can be considered one of the best in the league. He missed only 1 game his entire career thus far and looks primed to be even better in year 7. Last year, he totalled 1,572 yards and 11 TDs. For fantasy purposes, Hopkins is currently being taken as the #1 WR and deservingly so.\nHe and quarterback Deshaun Watson form one of the best duos in the league and are sure to improve next year. However, the one concern is the 70.6% catch percentage that’s likely to see some regression. His career mark is set at 58.8% making last year’s percentage seem like an anomaly. If his usage rate increases and he continues catching passes at an elite rate, Hopkins has a great shot at repairing the exceptional performance as last year.\xa0\nHow much better can Deshaun Watson get?\nThe other youngster on the Texans is Deshaun Watson. He enters his 3rd season and looks primed for a big payday after what he did last year. As Houston’s full time starter, Watson passed for 4165 yards and 26 TDs. The interceptions might be a bit high but he makes up for it by being a dual threat QB. He also ran for 5 TDs in 2018 and made himself a household name.\nWhile he’s yet to find success in the playoffs, the core around him will give Watson plenty of passing options. If nothing opens up, he’s always got the legs to scramble and make something happen. The only bad part to his game was the sacks; in 2018, he was sacked 62 times for 384 yards, the worst in the league. If the line can hold it together and give Watson some actual time in the pocket, look for him to be a precision passer and become one of the most dangerous passers in the NFL.\xa0\nHow to replace Tyrann Mathieu\nAfter coming over from the Arizona Cardinals prior to last year, Tyrann Mathieu was terrific for the Texans. He had 2 interceptions and was a constant participant in their defensive schemes. He also tied his career high with 89 tackles, 70 of which were solo tackles. The 3 sacks were a career high and Mathieu will only look to add to that total with the Chiefs after signing a 3 year contract with them this offseason.\xa0\nTo replace him, the Texans brought in Tashaun Gipson from the Jacksonville Jaguars. He’s been a steady starter since his second year with the team and will likely slot into the free safety spot. The former division rival will now suit up for the Texans after collecting one interception and 54 tackles last year. While losing Mathieu is tough, they gain another veteran presence to a 3 year deal worth $19.5 million less than Mathieu., After making the Pro Bowl for the second year in a row, it’s questionable whether DeAndre Hopkins can be considered one of the best in the league.

However, the one concern is the 70.6% catch percentage that’s likely to see some regression. His career mark is set at 58.8% making last year’s percentage seem like an anomaly. If his usage rate increases and he continues catching passes at an elite rate, Hopkins has a great shot at repairing the exceptional performance as last year.\xa0, The other youngster on the Texans is Deshaun Watson. He enters his 3rd season and looks primed for a big payday after what he did last year. As Houston’s full time starter, Watson passed for 4165 yards and 26 TDs. The interceptions might be a bit high but he makes up for it by being a dual threat QB. He also ran for 5 TDs in 2018 and made himself a household name., While he’s yet to find success in the playoffs, the core around him will give Watson plenty of passing options. If nothing opens up, he’s always got the legs to scramble and make something happen. The only bad part to his game was the sacks; in 2018, he was sacked 62 times for 384 yards, the worst in the league. If the line can hold it together and give Watson some actual time in the pocket, look for him to be a precision passer and become one of the most dangerous passers in the NFL.\xa0, After coming over from the Arizona Cardinals prior to last year, Tyrann Mathieu was terrific for the Texans. He had 2 interceptions and was a constant participant in their defensive schemes. He also tied his career high with 89 tackles, 70 of which were solo tackles. The 3 sacks were a career high and Mathieu will only look to add to that total with the Chiefs after signing a 3 year contract with them this offseason.\xa0, To replace him, the Texans brought in Tashaun Gipson from the Jacksonville Jaguars. He’s been a steady starter since his second year with the team and will likely slot into the free safety spot. The former division rival will now suit up for the Texans after collecting one interception and 54 tackles last year. While losing Mathieu is tough, they gain another veteran presence to a 3 year deal worth $19.5 million less than Mathieu.]'}}

Look for a better offensive unit and a once again great defensive group.\xa0, \nWhat can Kirk Cousins do in Year 2?\nWith year after playing with the Vikings offense under his belt, Cousins should undoubtedly be a better player. He knows the offense and what has to be better in order for the team to win. While his stats were great last year, that didn’t help the ultimate goal of Minnesota. The 70.1 completion percentage and 30 TDs were career bests and the interceptions were fairly low at just 10. However, stats don’t always correlate to wins and that’s exactly what happened last year.\xa0\nThis year, it’ll be interesting to see what Cousins has in store for the Vikings. While he played well individually, the team wasn’t that successful. He’ll now have to rely heavily on the duo of Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen to be great again and trust having the ball in Dalvin Cook’s hands. Expect a similar season from Cousins who has great targets around him and will look to use them to exploit defenses once again.\xa0\nWhat does great depth at RB mean?\nDalvin Cook has been the lead back for the Vikings ever since he was drafted in the 2nd Round of the 2014 Draft but has yet to see much action. In two seasons, Cook has only been active for 15 games. That’s surely some concern for the Vikings who are counting on their young star to finally produce a fully healthy season and become their next big playmaker at the running back spot. Now, enter Ameer Abdullah after he played against them for Detroit over the past few seasons.\xa0\nAbdullah should be the clear #2 back in the backfield for Minnesota as they hope to give Cook some time off and rest him enough that he’ll be healthy for a full season. He gives an experienced back who’s capable of providing good minutes and going for 4-500 yards as a backup. Don’t count out rookie Alexander Mattison who should also receive a chance to get some carries in his first year. If Cook struggles, this might eventually become a running back by committee type of approach which will certainly help in keeping everyone’s legs fresh.\xa0\nWho’s Cousins’ third WR target?\nThroughout training camp, the Vikings’ top two wide receiver spots have been basically set in stone. Stefon Diggs is clearly the best threat down the sideline and looks to make great plays once again this year. Adam Thielen broke out a few years ago and hasn’t looked back since. His great catching ability and presence in the red zone have made him one of the best slot receivers in the game. The two of them for possibly the best 1-2 punch at the WR spot but the third receiver in the group has yet to be determined.\xa0\nSo far, it appears that the two front runners are Jordan Taylor and Chad Beebe. Taylor, a former Bronco, served mainly as a reserve in his career but has the ability to be a fairly productive starter. He knows the system after playing with Assistant Head Coach Gary Kubiak in Denver and can also provide value on special teams. Meanwhile, Beebe lacks experience but has the highest ceiling of the pair. He’s already earned high praise from Thielen and similarly offers experience at the special teams spot. While it’s still too early to call who’s the WR3 on the Vikings, whoever gets that spot figures to get a bunch of open looks and has a chance to be a great asset for Minnesota., With year after playing with the Vikings offense under his belt, Cousins should undoubtedly be a better player.

The Broncos are in a tough division, but do seem to be planning on making a playoff run. It’s going to be an uphill battle, but answering these questions may help., \nHow Big of an Upgrade is Joe Flacco?\nThe Broncos made an interesting decision when they decided to trade away Case Keenum to bring in Joe Flacco. Flacco was the long-term starter for the Ravens, before being replaced by Lamar Jackson at midseason last year. Unfortunately for the Broncos, it’s hard to see Flacco providing a major boost to this offense. At 34 years of age, Joe Flacco is likely on the decline anyway, which the stats seem to back up. He hasn’t posted a passer rating over 85 or thrown for 7 or more yards per attempt since the 2014 season. Flacco can still lead a solid offense when surrounded by the right pieces, but the same could’ve been said about Keenum. At this point in his career, Joe Flacco is probably nothing more than an adequate game manager who is as good as his supporting cast.\nWill the Broncos Have a Good Enough Interior Pass Rush?\nThe Broncos are lucky to possess two of the best edge rushers in the league in Von Miller and Bradley Chubb. Although the Broncos have been going downhill since the super bowl winning season, Miller hasn’t, as he put up yet another double-digit sack season last year. Chubb meanwhile, is coming off a fantastic rookie season that saw him rack up 12 sacks of his own. Those two will ensure the Broncos pass rush remains solid just by themselves, but depending on how well their teammates can support them, it has a chance to be one of the best in the league. Right now, they have a couple options to choose from, but none of them had over 3 sacks last season. Currently, the two most established options on the roster would be Derek Wolfe and Adam Gotsis, who started 16 and 12 games respectively last year. Some other intriguing players would be Shelby Harris, a former 7th round pick that had 5.5 sacks in 2017, Demarcus Walker, a 2017 second round pick, and Dre’Mont Jones, the rookie from Ohio State the Broncos took in the third round. The Broncos don’t even need an elite interior rusher, they just need someone who can consistently win their one on ones to take the pressure off Chubb and Miller. If they can do that, this Broncos defense has a chance to be special.\nIs this Offensive Supporting Cast Good Enough to Support Flacco?\nAs mentioned before, Joe Flacco is a player that isn’t capable of elevating a team at this point in his career. At the end of the day, it won’t be him who dictates how good the offense will be, but rather the talent around him. So let’s take a look at the Broncos offensive supporting cast. Last year, the supporting cast was unspectacular outside of a couple bright spots. This season, the Broncos seem to be lacking in receiving depth, as only two of their receivers, Courtland Sutton and Emmanuel Sanders, are proven. Other receivers like Daesean Hamilton and Tim Patrick showed promise, but not enough to prove they can handle the burden of being a featured receiver for a full season. At running back, the Broncos seem to have a different problem, as it feels like they have too many backs and not enough touches. While rookie sensation Phillip Lindsay will likely lead the way again, guys like Devontae Booker, Theo Riddick, and 2018 first round pick Royce Freeman will all need carries as well. Tight end will likely be the x-factor for the team. They’ve been pretty thin at the position for some time, which is why they drafted Noah Fant in the first round. If he can make an impact right away, he may be enough to elevate this supporting cast. And if the supporting cast is playing well, that means Flacco is playing well., The Broncos made an interesting decision when they decided to trade away Case Keenum to bring in Joe Flacco.

A lot of eyes will be on newly drafted defensive end Nick Bosa to see if he can breathe some life into this defense., \nWhat did the 49ers do to improve their secondary?\nThere's no denying the Niners had one of the worst secondary productions in the NFL last season. The 49ers seemed to believe their poor secondary play was a result of a bad pass rush. Therefore, they traded a 2020 second round draft pick for Dee Ford and then signed him to a big deal. They took Nick Bosa second overall, in another attempt to heighten their pass rush. Basically, the 49ers are attempting to improve their secondary without really changing their existing secondary. They're hoping that with increased competition and a stronger pass rush, there will just be better production this year than there was last year. It's definitely a strategy that isn't as cut and dry as, say, just going out and getting a top safety, but it could work. We'll know the extent to which it works pretty early on in the season.\nWhy is 2019/20 such an important season for San Fransisco?\nIt effectively determines whether or not the 49ers are on the right track for building their future, or if they'll have to go back to square one. Their defensive line is now comprised of 3 first round draft picks and a veteran in Dee Ford. If they aren't able to get it done with that defensive line then there doesn't feel like there's a whole lot that can be done to improve this team.

The season isn't important in the sense that anyone expects the 49ers to go on a post season run, but in the way that it will greatly impact the team's outlook moving forward.\nDo the 49ers have a top 10 pass rush in the NFL?\nAs mentioned before, the 49ers have three first round draft picks on their defensive line accompanied by veteran Dee Ford. All the reporting out of 49ers training camp seems to lend itself to the idea that this pass rush is a huge upgrade. Nick Bosa has seemed to be everything the 49ers had thought he'd be when they elected to take him second overall in this year's draft. Of course, training camp is one thing. The real results come during the 16 games of the season and it'll be interesting to watch just how much of an upgrade the Niners have in their defensive line from last year.

This is very much a transition year for them and should be treated as such. Still, there are a couple questions they can answer this season that could prove beneficial for their future., \nHow Effective will the Kingsbury-Murray Combo Be?\nThe Cardinals drew a lot of snark with their decision to hire Kingsbury as head coach, as it gave off the impression to some that the Cardinals were just copying the template the Rams set with Sean McVay. The fact that they were close friends didn’t help whispers that Kingsbury only got the job due to his similarities with McVay. Kyler Murray will be entering his rookie year with some questions as well. His talent is undeniable, but there are some concerns about his height and long-term durability. The point is, both the Cardinals’ head coach and presumed quarterback of the future enter the season with a lot of doubters. There’d be no better way to shut those doubters up by establishing a positive connection and relationship on the field as soon as possible. A strong rookie year from Murray isn’t a necessity, as he’s still a developing young player, but it’d definitely hush a lot of the noise.\nCan David Johnson Get His Mojo Back?\nAfter a strong start to his career, the hype around David Johnson has faded after a disastrous two seasons. First was his wrist injury that knocked him out for the entire 2017 season, and then came a poor 2018 season where he had a dismal yards per carry and struggled the whole season behind a poor offensive line. Johnson will be hoping an improved supporting cast will help him get his mojo back and allow his to reach the heights he had in the 2016 season. Getting back that version of Johnson would obviously help the team, but it’d be extremely beneficial to Kyler Murray’s growth. At his peak, Johnson is one of the best dual threats in football, able to grind out yards on the ground and provide a safety valve for his quarterbacks in the passing game. He wasn’t able to do that often for Josh Rosen last season, so if he could do it for Kyler Murray it’d make a huge difference. Regardless, Johnson is already 27 and already has some durability questions, so a bounce back season would be a great way to ease those concerns.\nWhat Would be a Successful Season for this Team?\nFor every team, expectations will vary, and each team should be judged through different lenses. Let’s get this out of the way. The Cardinals will almost certainly not make the playoffs next year. They’re probably more likely to once again repeat as the worst team in their division than they are to sniff a wild card spot. So, given how low expectations are for this team, what would qualify as a successful year for this team is important. No year or game is truly meaningless and for the Cardinals, they can find meaning in developing their young core. Obviously Kyler Murray is a part of it, but the Cardinals need to decide what other players on their roster they want to be part of their core going forward. After determining who they want to keep, getting them as much experience and reps possible should be the priority. This will likely result in a lot of losses, but the experience they give their young talents will give them a head start down the road., The Cardinals drew a lot of snark with their decision to hire Kingsbury as head coach, as it gave off the impression to some that the Cardinals were just copying the template the Rams set with Sean McVay. The fact that they were close friends didn’t help whispers that Kingsbury only got the job due to his similarities with McVay. Kyler Murray will be entering his rookie year with some questions as well. His talent is undeniable, but there are some concerns about his height and long-term durability. The point is, both the Cardinals’ head coach and presumed quarterback of the future enter the season with a lot of doubters. There’d be no better way to shut those doubters up by establishing a positive connection and relationship on the field as soon as possible. A strong rookie year from Murray isn’t a necessity, as he’s still a developing young player, but it’d definitely hush a lot of the noise., After a strong start to his career, the hype around David Johnson has faded after a disastrous two seasons. First was his wrist injury that knocked him out for the entire 2017 season, and then came a poor 2018 season where he had a dismal yards per carry and struggled the whole season behind a poor offensive line. Johnson will be hoping an improved supporting cast will help him get his mojo back and allow his to reach the heights he had in the 2016 season.
